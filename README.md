# Code Challenge Repo: One Repo to Rule Them All!

## Student

Please follow the instructions. If your instructor's instructions differ from below, always listen to your instructor instead.

### Do This Once Before Your First Ever Challenge

Before your first code challenge, please Star this repo. This will trigger an invitation to join this repo as a collaborator. Once you get the email invitation, please accept the invitation. Please note that it may take a while for the invitation to arrive depending on how many invites are in the queue. If you do not see an invite by the next day, please ask your instructor for help. They can add you manually if needed - just give them your GitHub username.

If you lose your invitation, go to the following link while logged in to GitHub: https://github.com/learn-co-students/repo-name/invitations (replace <repo-name> with the actual repo name). 

Note that invitations expire after 7 days.

Your instructor will make this repo private once you have all been added. 

Fork the repo (after it's Private). Your instructor will let you know when to fork.

Clone your fork down to your machine: `git clone repo-url.git`

Add a remote that points to the original cohort repo (the one you just forked): `git add remote upstream http://github.com/learn-co-students/original-repo-name.git`

### Instructions for Every Challenge

Before **every challenge**, pull the changes from the upstream repo into your master/main branch (Your instructor will tell you when):

1. `git checkout master` or `git checkout main`
2. `git pull upstream master` or `git pull upstream main`

Next, create and checkout a new branch. This is where you'll do your work:
1. `git checkout -b phase-1-round-1` (Or whatever name your instructor provides)
2. `cd directory-name` into the directory containing the code challenge. 

Work on the challenge and commit and push as you go along:
1. `git add -A` or `git add .` (to add your saved changes to staging)
2. `git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"`
3. `git push origin branch-name`, e.g. `git push origin phase-1-round-1`

_!!Please do not push to upstream!!_

At the end of the challenge, make your final commit and push your branch! Await your grade brave almighty student!


## Instructors

### Before the First Challenge

Please check that all students are listed as collaborators. They should have accepted their invitations also.

If any student does not appear and was not automatically added, please add them.

### Before Every Challenge

Please add the appropriate code challenge to this repo in its own directory. Ensure the .git folder is not in the code challenge folder. If you wish, you can remove previous code challenges from this repo.

Ask students to pull the repo's changes into their local master/main when ready, and then branch.

### After every challenge

Go through the forks and grade.

Put your grades in Canvas.

If you wish, remove the code challenge from the repo. If you keep old challenges in, please name the directories simply, e.g. "Phase-1-Code-Challenge-NameOfChallenge".

Thank you for your hard work!
